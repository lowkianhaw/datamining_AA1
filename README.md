#Introduction

Hypermarkets play a pivotal role in providing an extensive range of products and services to a diverse customer base. However, one of the significant challenges faced by hypermarkets is the issue of customer churn, where customers discontinue their association with the hypermarket and shift their loyalty elsewhere. The ability to predict and understand customer churn is crucial for hypermarkets to implement effective retention strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and maintain a competitive edge in the market.

This study focuses on delving into the intricate dynamics of hypermarket customer churn, utilizing decision trees to develop predictive insights. By leveraging historical transactional data, customer interactions, and demographic information, the study aims to uncover patterns and indicators that contribute to customer churn in hypermarkets.

#Objectives:

The objectives of the study on predicting hypermarket customer churn are as follows:
1.	To explore and analyze various factors that contribute to customer churn within hypermarkets.
2.	To utilize decision tree algorithms to develop accurate predictive models to predict customer churn.

Reflections and Learning Outcomes:

Talend Data Integration: Talend Data Integration provided a robust platform for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. The graphical interface made it intuitive to design data integration workflows. I gained proficiency in connecting to various data sources, transforming data, and loading it into different destinations. The tool's ability to handle complex transformations and support for big data technologies enhanced my data integration capabilities.

Talend Data Preparation: Talend Data Preparation simplified the data cleansing and enrichment process. Its visual profiling and cleaning features were instrumental in understanding data quality issues and addressing them efficiently. I learned how to identify and handle missing values and manage data inconsistency. The tool's ease of use accelerated the data preparation phase, contributing to better-quality input for subsequent analytics.

SAS Enterprise Miner: I acquired skills in building and evaluating predictive models using various algorithms within SAS Enterprise Miner. The tool's visualization capabilities enhanced my understanding of complex models and aided in communicating findings effectively.

Data preprocessing: I understood the importance of data preprocessing in ensuring accurate and meaningful results. There are lots of challenges in the dataset such as handling missing values and data inconsistency. Handling them bu using the 3 tools contributed to improved model performance.

Handling Overfitting and Underfitting of Decision Tree Model: Overfitting led to poor generalization, while underfitting resulted in overly simplistic models in the developed decision tree models.I gained insights into techniques for mitigating overfitting, such as pruning, adjusting hyperparameters, and using validation sets. Understanding the trade-offs between model complexity and performance was crucial in achieving well-balanced decision tree models.
