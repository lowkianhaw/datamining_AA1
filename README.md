#Introduction

Hypermarkets play a pivotal role in providing an extensive range of products and services to a diverse customer base. However, one of the significant challenges faced by hypermarkets is the issue of customer churn, where customers discontinue their association with the hypermarket and shift their loyalty elsewhere. The ability to predict and understand customer churn is crucial for hypermarkets to implement effective retention strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and maintain a competitive edge in the market.

This study focuses on delving into the intricate dynamics of hypermarket customer churn, utilizing decision trees to develop predictive insights. By leveraging historical transactional data, customer interactions, and demographic information, the study aims to uncover patterns and indicators that contribute to customer churn in hypermarkets.

#Objectives:
